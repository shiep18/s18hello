Quote form TI:"A built-in watchdog timer allows the CC2530 to reset itself in case the firmware hangs. When enabled by
software, the watchdog timer must be cleared periodically; otherwise, it resets the device when it times out. It can
alternatively be configured for use as a general 32-kHz timer."

There is no 32KHz oscillator on board ,hence I cannot complete this test.
